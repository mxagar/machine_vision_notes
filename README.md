# Notes on Machine Vision Algorithms and Applications

This repository contains my personal notes on Machine Vision Algorithms and Applications.

It is heavily influenced by my experience with Halcon, but the notes consider also other technologies, such as OpenCV and PCL, among others.

This is an **on-going project** which will collect the most important insights I have gathered along the past years. I will add a table of contents when the project has acquired some shape; until then, feel free to peek the self-explanatory files.
